# FEM-Solver-for-2D-Heat-Conduction
A MATLAB-based FEM solver for 2D heat conduction problems defined in a rectangular domain.

Features:

1) Arbitrary domain size
2) Structured mesh with triangular elements and mesh size control
3) Allows for temperature, heat flux and convection boundary conditions along with local heat generation
4) Results displayed in terms of a 2D heat flux plot and a 3D temperature distribution plot
